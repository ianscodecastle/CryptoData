The goal of my project is to create a web dashboard that displays the current price, market cap,
and percentage gains for cryptocurrencies. I plan to accomplish this through data engineering. Using Python, I will connect to a data source and extract the raw data on the cryptocurrencies. Next, I will transform the data and load it onto Amazon AWS. From there, I will be able to place the transformed data on my web dashboard.

So far, the bulk of my work has been devoted to researching different data sources in order to determine which API I want to use for my project. I have tested out CoinMarketCap, Messari, CoinAPI, and CoinGecko so far. As of now, CoinMarketCap and CoinAPI are the frontrunners. I have made simple Python scripts with each of these APIs in order to see how simple the process is and how well the documentation explains how to use the API. I have also been using GitHub to keep track of all of this progress. Lastly, I have been using Trello to have a sprint board where I keep track of every individual task in the project.

The next step I need to take is to make a final decision on where I will be getting the data from. Once I know which API I want to use, I can spend more time writing more complex code. Additionally, I plan to get more familiar with using Amazon AWS and gain a more thorough understanding of how to load my data into an S3 bucket.
