Initial Project Idea (1/14/22)

For my project, I will be using data engineering to create a dashboard that will let users
see statistics for cryptocurrencies they are interested in. I want to use a scheduling system to refresh the data and automatically keep the stats on the dashboard up-to-date. I think this will be helpful for investors who want to see statistical breakdowns of cryptocurrencies all in one centralized location. I am attempting this project because I work in data engineering and want to do more projects related to my field.

I plan to use Python, Docker, and Amazon AWS to implement my project. Python will be used to access an API to extract crypto exchange data. Additionally, it will be used to transform and load the data into my Amazon AWS data warehouse. Docker will be used to help facilitate the connection between my code and the data warehouse.

My desired outcome is to have a working python script that performs ETL to accurately reflect the price, market cap, price movement, etc. for different cryptocurrencies. I hope to have a well-designed dashboard to display this data, but it isnâ€™t my main focus.
